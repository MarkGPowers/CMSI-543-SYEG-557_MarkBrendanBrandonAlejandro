General
This is amazing work!

Section 1.1
Nice job here ~ excellent for a preliminary document

Section 1.2
This is a great start, and very complete for a preliminary document.  You
   might think about how to break your child stories down even a little
   further.  Try to think in terms of 'if I were going to code this part,
   what would I need to know?'  Once you get to THAT level, you are usually
   at the right detail.

Section 1.3
Excellent!

Section 1.4
Excellent!

Section 1.5
Excellent!

All in all, very nice work on this!  Professional-quality work which is
   an "A-plus" job.
