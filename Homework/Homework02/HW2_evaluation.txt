A few comments:

problem 6.7 ~ something else to consider, mentioned in the text, is that
   with the larger numbers in the Fibonacci series there is less certainty
   of the actual 'size' of the task.  The bigger the number, the more it
   is likely that task will be broken down into smaller user stories.

Nice work!
