Total possible points: 23
Total possible score: 23 out of 23 = 100% which is an A-plus

Your score: 22.5 out of 23 = 97.83% which is an A-plus

Excellent answers, well thought out and using your own critical thinking
   skills!

On problem 8.13, you've provided the status answers, but the question asks
   you what MORE does the stand-up provide.  It's a chance for the team to
   'calibrate' the team's progress for the iteration to see how they are
   doing overall with the sprint, as well as to provide assistance to team
   member[s] who may be stuck.

Great job on this final assignment!
